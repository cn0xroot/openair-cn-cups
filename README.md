# openair-cn-cups

## Development - First steps using Visual Studio Code

1. Download vscode available [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
1. Clone the repository openair-cn-cups
1. Open the console in your workspace
1. Create a macvlan docker network  running ```make docker-create-network```. It is assumed that you have two network device, one of them is the enp0s20f0u1 (See [Makefile](Makefile)).
1. Setup "[Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/container)" in vscode
1. [Open the repository workspace using vscode in a conteiner](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_open-an-existing-workspace-in-a-container) (it will take some time)
1. Setup conteiner network: ```make docker-setup-network```  
1. Create and configure spgwu interfaces: ```make docker-config-spgwu-iface```  

## Environment

See [environment.](https://github.com/navarrothiago/masters/wiki/OpenAirInterface#lte-test-environment)

## Build code using Visual Studio Code

Follow the steps to build spgwu in vscode

1. Run Build Task ```Ctrl + Shift + B```
1. Select ```Rebuild spgwu```

## Run spgwu

1. Run spgwu ```F5```

### Display all UDP sockets

Run the command ```ss -u -a```

Output:

```
State                   Recv-Q                    Send-Q                                        Local Address:Port                                        Peer Address:Port                   
UNCONN                  0                         0                                                127.0.0.11:48062                                            0.0.0.0:*                      
UNCONN                  0                         0                                             172.55.55.102:40280                                            0.0.0.0:*                      
UNCONN                  0                         0                                             172.55.55.102:8805                                             0.0.0.0:*                      
UNCONN                  0                         0                                              192.168.15.2:2152                                             0.0.0.0:* 
```

The following table maps the socket to the spgwu protocal stack:

app | socket
--- | --- 
spgwu-pfcp | 172.55.55.102:8805
spgwu-gtpv1_u | 192.168.5.2:2151

### IP Mapping

``` 
VM -> Docker
192.168.15.14 -> 192.168.15.2
10.50.11.227 -> 172.17.0.2
```
## Other commands

### Build spgwu docker image

```
make docker-build
```

### Build spgwu in debug mode

```
make debug
```

### Clean spgwu generated artifacts 

```
make clean
```

### Login spgwu docker container in bash mode

```
make shell-run
```
