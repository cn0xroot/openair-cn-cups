# openair-cn-cups

## Development - First steps using Visual Studio Code

1. Download vscode available [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
1. Clone the repository openair-cn-cups
1. Open the console in your workspace
1. Create a macvlan docker network  running ```make docker-create-network```. It is assumed that you have two network device, one of them is the enp0s20f0u1 (See [Makefile](Makefile)).
1. Setup "[Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/container)" in vscode
1. [Open the repository workspace using vscode in a conteiner](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_open-an-existing-workspace-in-a-container) (it will take some time)
1. Setup conteiner network: ```make docker-setup-network```
